	<div class="entry-content">
		
<p>Take a finished product. It is the result of years of collaboration between a content creator and Cumulative Records Documentation Society. What was the process that led to this result? What would the process entail for another creator, such as you?</p>



<p>This page describes the life cycle of an archived work. It starts from the initial idea. It ends with the finished work&#8217;s inclusion in a long-term archive that will outlive anyone involved in the initial creation process. Examples of archived works can be ambitious, such as a full video series with an accompanying text for self-study. </p>



<p>More often, we archive collections of smaller, less ambitious works such as slideshows (e.g., PowerPoint), instructional videos/tutorials, documents needed to run a 1-hour learning event, handouts, data sets, labs, books, and creative works. CRDS only produces materials for public use. Over time, these works are published as a collection. Eventually, the CRDS producer will work with the content creator to repurpose these materials into one combined, polished, perfect product. </p>



<p>How slow is the process? It may take a decade. Is it worth the effort? Absolutely! CRDS loves working with people who are passionate about their craft. We welcome those from diverse backrounds, including those with non-privileged histories and/or people who display obsessive, perfectionist qualities. Nothing makes our organization more proud than to help such individuals assemble their life&#8217;s work into a focused archival piece for the ages. We take great pride in the process, which culminates in submitting a well-designed body of work to an archiving organization so it can outlive all of us who helped create it.</p>



<p>How do we map out this process? We recognize four distinct stages in our production process. </p>



<ol><li>Initial Idea.</li><li>Setup with CRDS.</li><li>Development in Open Drawer Archive (Incubation).</li><li>Submission to Internet Archive (Immortality). </li></ol>



<h2>1. Initial Idea.</h2>



<p>This step has likely already occurred before the creator contacted CRDS. If you believe you may already have an idea, we encourage you to <a href="http://cumulativerecords.org/contact/">contact us</a> right away.</p>



<p>Why would the previous sentence be worded in such a funny way? Would it not be clear to a person whether they had an idea? </p>



<p>In our experience, it is not obvious which ideas have high potential to be developed into an archived work. We see two situations where a person is likely to have a high-potential idea.</p>



<p>Situation #1: You think something along the lines of, &#8220;I have this certain need for a certain material again.&#8221; This cognition occurs in a creators&#8217; role at work and/or as an instructor. A common example is a presenter who has developed a basic sequence for delivering the presentation. It may start with a website to show the audience, then move to slideshows, handouts, a demonstration, video clips, a booklet, etc.). </p>



<p>The Normal Case, Which Does Not Interest Us: Some of these materials are developed to the minimum amount of structure needed for the presenter to use them. This is also known as &#8220;satisficing.&#8221; It occurs when a worker is given a task but not provided with the resources needed to develop the materials fully.</p>



<p>The Exceptional Case, Which Interests Us: It is unusual for a presenter to take the extra time (which can be excessive and is probably unpaid) to develop materials thoroughly enough for other people to implement themselves. Much of the information needed to share the materials in their role resides in the mind of the presenter. This is called &#8220;optimizing.&#8221; It occurs when a worker is given a task and somehow finds the intrinsic or extrinsic resources needed to develop the materials fully. </p>



<p>Examples of so-called &#8220;Optimizers&#8221; may include: Workers who will stay late at the office to format a spread sheet, salaried employees who come in on Saturday to color code a binder system, and workers who sacrifice sleep to finish a task until it is done right.</p>



<p>At CRDS, we have met many people who would like to be optimizers. Our system is designed to give people the support they need to function as optimizers, in terms of materials they could create and perfect over time.</p>



<p>Our optimizers start out by looking at their materials, saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need a step-by-step guide because I can work around the fact that it&#8217;s only somewhat structured. I know it because I created it.&#8221; After some time, they think, &#8220;I wonder if other people are in a similar situation? Could the work I am doing now be useful to them? After all, look at all the time I had to sacrifice just to get these materials to their current state&#8230;&#8221; </p>



<p>If that sounds familiar to you, we urge you to <a href="http://cumulativerecords.org/contact/">contact us</a>. </p>



<p>There is one more rare situation that might sound like you. The rarest of all optimizers is one who wonders, &#8220;Well, if I made my own materials, maybe other people out there have made their own versions of similar materials that are also somewhat developed. If only there was a way to combine forces and then we could all just use one good version&#8230;&#8221; That line of thinking is what CRDS is all about. Note that our thought process does not include &#8220;&#8230;and then I&#8217;ll be rich!!!&#8221; It&#8217;s about quality to us, not finding a way to profit by outcompeting our peers. </p>



<p>Is there an historical example of this kind of approach? An example that comes to mind is how King James built a concordance for the King James Bible. It was a huge undertaking that required scholars to compare many similar versions of various biblical works. Some were apocryphal texts, others were attributed to a source. The team found the set of works that seemed to best convey a cohesive message and represented the main components of the various, often incompatible versions.  The result was a contribution to a religion, not a project designed to maximize profits. We have no interest in being affiliation with any religious organization whatsoever. However, we mention this example because we believe helping creators archive high-quality work is a higher calling. We are a public charity and the work itself is our reward.</p>



<p>We have perfected a technology for making that happen. If you would be interested in such a thing, please <a href="http://cumulativerecords.org/contact/">contact us</a> to discuss your ideas today.</p>



<p>Scenario #2: Sometimes we meet people who have worked with for-profit publishers in the past. They may have had a taste of what it is like to have a team helping them create materials. This is a wonderful experience!  CRDS can help with this type of situation but from the the perspective of a nonprofit. </p>



<p>We are different because we make sure the whole process is publicly available. This adds transparency and allows for feedback in a way that is structured and useful. We add the support of a producer throughout the process to shield creators from common pitfalls and hidden traps that prevent good projects from getting done. </p>



<p>We also take the time to provide education to the creators, in the event that they are interested in learning more about the process. These are not the things you will find from a for-profit publishing house because their job demands require higher turnaround and more deliverables. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Ultimately, we help you perfect and archive your craft so people can enjoy it after you die. We give them a chance to discover what you did when you were alive. None of us will ever know the long-term result but that is part of the fun. We make the materials the best we can with the resources we have. For people who are into that idea, it&#8217;s great motivation and pushes them to new levels of mastery with their craft. </p><cite>B. Theisen, CRDS Technical Producer.</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is why we emphasize <em>the process</em> of supporting creators for however long it takes. We would rather help you produce one excellent, long-lasting collection than to help 10,000 people make half-baked throwaway content. This mentality surely guarantees that no publishing house will try to buy us up. As you can imagine, we love that!</p>



<p>We have our own system to help creators bring their ideas into fruition. We help with the development process over the course of years. At Cumulative Records Documentation Society, our technical producers use the phrase &#8220;production-ready&#8221; to describe materials that have met the following standards:</p>



<ol><li>Licensed for Public Use. An example is the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons 4.0 &#8211; Attribution &#8211; Sharealike &#8211; Non-commercial License</a>.</li><li>Sufficient. Materials should have sufficient information for a reasonably intelligent person to implement without contacting the author. </li></ol>



<h2>2. Collaboration with CRDS.</h2>



<p>This step takes 3 months to 3 years. CRDS provides a technical producer to work on each project. The producer works somewhat like an engineer in the sense that we prioritize form over content. The producer works through the basic steps below. </p>



<ol><li>Preparing the materials for pubic use. This involves checking for copyright infringement, obtaining release forms and permissions as needed, entering an agreement with the creator to release materials to the public, etc.</li><li>Defining the audience for the proposed materials.</li><li>Proposing initial cuts or additions, then proceeding collaboratively with the creator in an ongoing partnership to develop the materials.</li><li>Implementing changes in various long-term, universally compatible languages and formats.</li><li>Providing education and training.</li></ol>



<h2>3. Development in Open Drawer Archive.</h2>



<p>This step takes 1 to 10+ years. At this point, some creators work on the ideas intermittently across years and pass the leadership role to someone else. The creator retains credit for the initial work completed.</p>



<ol><li>Development Tools. It would be a wasted effort to build materials without a system to develop them beyond the creator&#8217;s initial vision. Besides, we have found that many creators are perfectionists and would never make their work available to others if they believed it needed to be &#8220;ready&#8221; first. To make sure projects actually get done, CRDS develops a clear plan to develop and maintain versions of the materials.  <ol><li>Tools. Our partnership with GitHub gives our community access to Issue Tracking and Version Control tools, through which others can download versions of the materials, give feedback, and propose actual line-level edits to improve the overall materials. Creators tend to like this approach because they can tinker with improvements over the years when they have the time/energy/interest to do it. They tend to like that colleagues have the ability to collaborate openly, though in practice most colleagues will not contribute. </li><li>Releases. Periodically, the producer and creator can create a stable release or updated version of the current materials. This is made obvious to others, who can see that some new improvement has occurred. They can subscribe to notifications about the creator&#8217;s updates and passively listen to changes you make over the years. They may not actively suggest changes unless they choose to do so.  We usually find that a small &#8220;following&#8221; or community forms around a set of materials. The following includes people who have made similar materials in the past or have an ongoing need to use materials like what the creator developed. This results in more collaboration, leading to higher-quality materials for everybody. GitHub&#8217;s tools track every note, comment, update, etc. at the command line-level.</li></ol></li><li>Incubation to Immortality. We take steps to make sure the materials outlive their creators. <ol><li>The ultimate goal is to submit an archive-quality, self-contained, well-vetted stable release of a creator&#8217;s work to the Internet Archive at <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a>. We say these materials have &#8220;reached immortality&#8221; because their availability will outlive anyone who created the initial releases.  </li><li>Incubation. Before reaching immortality, we incubate the materials in our own long-term archive, which we call the Open Drawer Archive (ODA). Conceptually, ODA is housed on a network of servers and development platforms. We do this because the materials are still being developed and tested, not production-ready yet. This makes ODA different from a single website (like archive.org) where a person can place a single search. We may change that delivery mode in the future. For now, it works for us. We say, &#8220;If archive.org is like a car dealership, ODA is the unseen factory where prototypes are sketched out, built, crash-tested, put through focus groups, and mass-produced before being shipped off to the dealership.&#8221;</li><li>Alpha vs. Beta Mode. Materials enter ODA in <em>alpha mode</em>, meaning their creator(s)/producer(s) are actively making major changes to the materials. This can last for weeks, months, or years. We are patient and do not expect creators to drop everything to make materials. The next phase is <em>beta mode</em>, meaning the creator(s)/ producer(s) fine-tune the materials as others test-drive them. Changes made to a beta release are usually subtle and would not interfere with implementation. By way of example, &#8220;adding a page for a new topic&#8221; is part of alpha development. Changing some behind-the-scenes code to make the existing page load faster on a browser is part of beta development. Over the years and decades, the process of alpha and beta releases repeats. The process results in more stable releases that benefit the community. All the original releases remain available. We never delete any of the changes and they always remain public. </li></ol></li></ol>



<h2>4.  Submission to Internet Archive. </h2>



<p>This step is performed in an instant but the results outlive us all.</p>



<ol><li>We submit a variety of universally-compatible formats to the Internet Archive. For example, many people use Microsoft Office for work and school but your project will still be available for download in 100 years.  It also costs money and may need expensive computers to operate. These luxuries are perhaps taken for granted in some communities but we do not want to exclude persons from nations where Internet access, recently-built computers, and ongoing cloud subscriptions are impossible or impose hardship. </li><li>CRDS producers handle the code-conversion for creators. We do not expect creators to learn HTML, for example, or to recite broadcast standards when recording video. It is great if creators knew all of these things but we do not expect them to do any heavy-lifting beyond simply thinking about their own materials. </li><li>In terms of specific systems, HTML is a great example because it runs on any browser with or without an Internet connection. LaTeX is a typesetting system that can also make slideshows. It uses a command line interface that works on any system (with some learning curve). What about plain text files? Computer code written in ANSI-C? We go the extra mile to use computer languages and file formats that have survived standards committees and/or have support from established nonprofit foundations. </li><li>Creators like that CRDS producers write the code and handle these classic systems for them. We appreciate the fact that code written in the C programming language in the 1970&#8217;s still runs on machines today. We provide that sense of long-term stability to our creators as a way to honor the time and care they put into the development of their materials. </li><li>For video, we use equipment that meets or exceeds current broadcasting standards. This helps ensure compatibility in the future. Also, it gives creators confidence to know that we will not lose the footage at their shoot. We have huge batteries and redundant recordings systems with broadcast workflows. Nothing is lost at the front of the room when CRDS runs the shoot.</li></ol>
